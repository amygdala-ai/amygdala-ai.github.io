		"brief": "High dimensionality of feature space is a problem in supervised machine learning. Redundant or superfluous features either slow down the training process or dilute the quality of classification. In this paper, we propose a fuzzified adaptation of discernibility matrix with four variants of dissimilarity measure to deal with continuous data."

Such subjective assessment may be apparently influenced by ineligible inaccuracies. In this paper, we have proposed a novel segmentation model utilizing the SURF blob detector and locally adaptive binarization."
